# Deliverable 1 - Project Specifications

Name: Sam Schweinsberg

## Overview to summarize project 
Have you ever found yourself needing to make dinner, but find yourself at a loss as to what to make? 
This handy little dinner picker is the perfect solution for you. Input what ingredients you have into this app, and it 
spits out potential recipes for you to use! No more wondering and scrolling Google as you desperately find ways to obtain nourishment! 
## Create a Concept section to detail your project idea.

At its base point, I want this project to be able to take user input and search for matches among lists of ingredients for recipes, 
and display those matches based on a scaling match percentage. 

I want to intially keep this project simple, because it is INCREDIBLY easy to get lost in all of the features that can be added to it. 

So the following is the base design, and if I end up going 'this is just TOO easy', I'll add more. 

* You'll be able to input ingredients that you have/want to work with. The intial input will not be saved, though that may be a feature 
added down the road. If implemented, you'll be able to cross off or remove ingredients you've inputted and stored as you use them. 

* This project will show recipe results as a list, with the highest matches towards the top, and the lowest towards the bottom. An 
upgrade to this feature would be to filter results. 

* I'd like for this project to contain substitues as well. If you don't have milk but have almond milk, it might be tagged as a substitue 
ingredient. 


##Create a Requirements section with preliminary specifications.

* Software must have some sort of input for the users to put their ingredients in. 

* Software must utilize recipe web-scrapers to find recipes. 

* Software must somehow sort and store recipe ingredients and the recipe itself. 

* Software must be able to compare the user-inputted ingredients against the stored recipe list. 

* Software must be able to calculate percentage matches. 

* Software must be able to display matches to the user on a scale of the percentage match.
