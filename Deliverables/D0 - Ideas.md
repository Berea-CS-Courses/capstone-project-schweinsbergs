# Deliverable 0 - Project ideas

Name: Sam Schweinsberg

## Ideas

 Sudoku 
- This kind of solves the problem of boredom. I rather like Sudoku, but I can 
never seem to find an app of it that I enjoy. I imagined it could be just a 
simple app, and that's something anyone can play. It's a 3.5. 

Mental Health Tracker
- This pandemic has been horrible for everyone's mental health. I've seen
a lot of my coworkers at work either drop out or just lose all of their 
enthusiasm that they once had. I wanted to see about creating an app 
that was akin to how we had to report our symptoms to the school every day, 
but with mental health. It might internally 'score' answers and alert users
to potential downswings in mood/worsening mental health. This would be an app, 
 mostly for young adults. Another 3.5 

*Prefered Idea* - Meal 'Helper'
* Another thing that's been happening big time is having to coordinate and 
create meals. I've heard it over and over, and I've said it over and over 
'I'm sick of picking out what's for dinner!', especially when you need to scour 
the cabinets and figure out what you do and don't have. So, this app is for 
those who need to cook, I imagine this would be good for anyone who cooks, 
from teens to elderly. This would be best as an app or a website, I believe. 
This one runs at a 4.5 for me.
