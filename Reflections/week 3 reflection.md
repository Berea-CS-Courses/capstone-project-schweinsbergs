#What have you accomplished this week? 

This week, I managed to do 2 out of my 3 goals. I managed to figure out a webcrawler of *sorts*, 
and use it to feed URLs into my dataframe.

Here's what my excel sheet looks like. 

# What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?

This week's challenges consisted of learning exactly how websites actually format their 
many URLs. I could use a web crawler, though what I found was that to be web crawler friendly 
(easy advertising!), websites will often have a sitemap. I can use google sheets to pull 
each of those urls off of a sitemap, one for each cell, and then feed that excel sheet 
into my webscraper. 

#What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)

Next week, I plan on cleaning up the data that I test against the user's data so we don't have 
words like 'cup', etc, that are messing up the results of the comparison. I suspect this could take 
3-5 hours... 

I also want to clean up my code, which could take 1-3 hours depending on how invested I get in it. 

I'd like to try fixing the broken images that are supposed to display with matched recipes, and 
I'm not quite sure how to go about it, so I want to estimate it could take 3+ hours because I need
to do research as well. 

Lastly, I want to play around with Kivy, which I want to dedicate at least 2 hours to, just to
be prepared for the week after this one. 

# What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)

Youtube, stackoverflow, and documentation for respective libraries (I don't quite know which webcrawler I want to use 
yet.)
