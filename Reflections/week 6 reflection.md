## What have you accomplished this week?

* Got the UI Finished
* Got the UI to accept input through a tkinter box
* Displayed the dataframe on screen to user.

## What challenges or difficulties did you face?

This week I got the UI finished-- It takes input in a box through tkinter, and it displays the dataframe using
pandasgui. I ended up compromising a lot there, I at the very least wanted to be able to display it through tkinter, but
that's alright. It's readable, and at this point, that's a winner.

## What do you plan on accomplishing in the following week?

Next week I want to get bug fixes and testing out of the way. I imagine this could take 6-10 hours depending on
how many bugs I end up finding. I also want to get my presentation ready, which I imagine will be the easiest thing we
have done this semester... I hope that only takes me 2-3 hours.

## What resources will you use to accomplish your goals?

Other students and roommates for my tests, and for my bugs, stackoverflow.
