#What have you accomplished this week? 

This week, I managed to iterate over the dataframe to pull the recipe information. 
When I do this, I switch the information in the ingredients column into a list so I can 
compare. 

Then, I compare that list against the ingredients the user put in. 

The program keeps track of how many matches there are in the list, and then creates a 
percentage matched for each recipe, and spits out the matches. 

# What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?

I had problems trying to figure out how to navigate dataframes. I hopped between the 
Pandas documentation and Stackoverflow to try and figure out how to do what I 
accomplished this week. 

#What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)

Next week, I want to incorporate a web crawler to supplement my web scraper so I don't 
have to manually add each URL into the web scraper. I estimate that could take 
3-4 hours, because I've never messed around with a web crawler and I'm not sure how 
they work, but they seem pretty straightforward. 

I also want to automatically feed my web scraper with the information FROM the web crawler,
most likely having the program read from a text file. I imagine this will take 2 or 3 hours 
to set up, and then it maaay take some time to run depending on how much information I want to put into the 
scraper itself. 

Lastly, I want to pull the 'extra' words out of my ingredient list. Things like 'cups', 'tsp', etc
so that I can get more accurate results as a comparison. I can throw them back in for matches so the user can actually 
KNOW how to create the recipe, but it's throwing a wrench in the comparisons. I expect this 
could take 4-5 hours? 

# What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)

Youtube, stackoverflow, and documentation for respective libraries (I don't quite know which webcrawler I want to use 
yet.)
