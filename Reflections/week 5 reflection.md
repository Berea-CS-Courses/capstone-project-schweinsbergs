#What have you accomplished this week? 

This week, I managed to get the dataframe to compare the user input against the 
dataframe input. Then, I calculated the matches by creating a list of the matched
words and figuring out how many are there versus in the dataframe recipe. Then, I appended
that percentage to the dataframe in a new column, and sorted the dataframe by the percentage. 

# What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?

I encountered a challenge of trying to figure out how to effectively compare user 
input against the dataframe. I ended up having to make a meeting with a TA, Jess, to figure out 
how to approach this problem, and what I could do to fix it. He helped me get it all sorted out. 

#What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)

Next week, I want to implement UI-- At least allowing the user to put in their ingredients, 
but I want to also display matches and the dataframe to the user. I imagine this could 
take 4-5 hours. 

I also want to start the testing plan, if I can get the UI done, I'd like to do a cognitive 
walkthrough. Otherwise, I'm going to start either a unit or end to end test.
