#What have you accomplished this week? 

This week I only really managed one of my goals, which was to clean up my code. 

I removed some code that functionally did nothing, such as the scraping() function, or 
a bunch of test statements that I was hanging onto. I also commented my code to heck and 
back, just to make sure that I wasn't going to get lost anywhere. 

I've been searching up some different methods, such as using regex or fuzzy logic to 
do comparisons of the user's data and my dataframe. 

I don't really have much to show, so I'm going to just toss in the way that ingredients are 
put into the dataframe so you can see what I'm working with.

# What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?

The challenge that I ran into this week is comparing strings against each other that may 
or may not be decent matches, but will have 'parts' of each other in them. I have an idea in 
mind to fix them, but I haven't actually fixed them yet. 

As mentioned in class, I think I may use a combination of fuzzy logic along with the regex to do 
comparisons to make them as accurate as possible. I just have to figure out how to use them.

#What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)

Next week, I plan on figuring out the fuzzy and regex library enough to get the comparisons of 
user data versus the dataframe's ingredients. I plan on that taking... I'm bad with time estimates.
Maybe 4-6 hours? 

I then plan on implementing it, which may take 2-3 hours. 

Then, I want to work with kivy to try to at least implement the title screen. This may take 4-5 hours
considering the research as well. 

# What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)

Youtube, stackoverflow, and documentation for respective libraries. (Regex, fuzzy...)
