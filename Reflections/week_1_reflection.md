## What have you accomplished this week? 

* I got in user input and turned it into a list 
* I iterated over the dataframe to pull information from a certain column (the recipes)
* I've been researching web crawlers and new ways to scrape information, and how the process works 

## What challenges or difficulties did you face? 

Right now I'm having issues actually manipulating the dataframe, and comparing the ingredients data. The 
reason for this is because it contains words like 'cups', 'tsp', etc. I'll have to consider stripping those 
in the comparison. I didn't get it fixed this week, though I have reached out with a few students and plan 
on going to TAs. 

## What do you plan on accomplishing in the following week? 

* Figuring out how to compare user's list against the ingredients list, even if it still has the 
caveat of ingredient amount. 
  
* Calculating the percentage matched. 

* Adding more data to compare against. 

## What resources will you use to accomplish your goals? 

Stackoverflow, always. Google. 

TAs, other students.
